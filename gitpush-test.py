# ok, so I found that when someone else directly makes a change and commits it to the main branch, then it won't highlight that change in vscode
# it will only show the updated file directly which can be viewed when u press synchronize button (on bottom-left) in vscode.

# let's try using a pull request option and see what happens in that case

def pulltest():
    print("Hello world pt2")
    
# just a test file to see if git commit and git push works properly
